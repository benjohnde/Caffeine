# Caffeine

Helps your Mac to stay awake.

[Caffeine Retina Icons](https://webjac.com/design/caffeine-retina-icons/) by James Creixems.

In homage to the original [Caffeine](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/) which seems to be discontinued.

## Build

```bash
sh build.sh
```

It automatically copies Caffeine to `/Applications/Caffeine.app`. Enjoy!

## Usage

Right click on the icon to close Caffeine.
